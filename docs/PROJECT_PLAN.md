# Dota 2 Joke Generator - Project Plan

## Project Overview
A web application that generates random Dota 2 jokes based on user selections. Users can select Dota 2 heroes and scenarios to create customized jokes.

## Core Features
1. **Random Joke Generation**: Generate random jokes with a single button press
2. **Hero Selection**: Allow users to select one or multiple Dota 2 heroes
3. **Scenario Selection**: Pre-defined scenarios or joke templates
4. **Social Sharing**: Ability to share jokes on social media
5. **Save Favorites**: Let users save their favorite jokes

## User Experience
- **Simple Interface**: Clean, intuitive UI with Dota 2 theme
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works well on all device sizes
- **Quick Loading**: Fast experience with minimal waiting
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the app is accessible to all users

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**:
  - Next.js (React framework)
  - TypeScript for type safety
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - Framer Motion for animations

- **Backend**:
  - Next.js API routes
  - MongoDB or similar for storing jokes and user favorites (if needed)

- **Deployment**:
  - GitHub for version control
  - Vercel for hosting and deployment

## Data Requirements
1. **Hero Database**:
   - Complete list of Dota 2 heroes
   - Basic attributes (strength/agility/intelligence)
   - Hero roles
   - Special abilities
   - Hero relationships (allies/enemies)

2. **Joke Templates**:
   - Collection of templates with placeholders for heroes
   - Categories (funny, sarcastic, in-game situations, etc.)
   - Difficulty level references

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup & Foundation
- Create GitHub repository
- Set up Next.js project with TypeScript
- Configure Tailwind CSS
- Create basic project structure
- Set up Vercel deployment

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
- Implement hero selection component
- Create scenario selection component
- Build joke generation logic
- Design basic UI layout

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
- Add social sharing functionality
- Implement favorites system (if using backend)
- Add animations and transitions
- Polish UI/UX

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment
- Test on different devices and browsers
- Gather feedback and iterate
- Final deployment to Vercel
- Setup CI/CD pipeline

## Future Enhancements
- User accounts for saving preferences
- Custom joke submission by users
- Upvoting/downvoting system
- Integration with Dota 2 API for real-time hero data
- Voice narration of jokes

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 1 week
- Phase 2: 2 weeks
- Phase 3: 1 week
- Phase 4: 1 week

## Questions to Consider
- How many heroes should users be able to select at once?
- What types of scenarios would be most engaging?
- Should jokes be curated or algorithmically generated?
- How to ensure jokes are appropriate and not offensive?
- Should we include references to current meta/patches?
